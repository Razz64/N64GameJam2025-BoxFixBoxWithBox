The game is mostly complete, but I ran out of time. Busy past few months.

The one main problem is the memory leak. If the screen turns black, just restart the console and select the level you were on.

I'd love to spend more time on this idea and flesh it out more, as well as fix the performance and other bugs.

To build, it is currently set up such that it must be inside of a folder that is inside the tiny3d folder. Simply change it to your tiny3d location in the make file if that doesn't work for you.
